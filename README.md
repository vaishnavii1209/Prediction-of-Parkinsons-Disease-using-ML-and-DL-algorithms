# Prediction-of-Parkinsons-Disease-using-ML-and-DL-algorithms

Parkinson’s Disease Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Overview

This project aims to detect Parkinson’s disease from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It applies image preprocessing and deep learning techniques to classify MRI scans as Parkinson’s positive or negative. A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to perform predictions easily, while SQLite manages and stores prediction results.
